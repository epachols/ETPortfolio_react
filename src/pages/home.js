            <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a Chef-turned-Full Stack Developer I have my hands
                  in the dirt, and a weather eye on the horizon.
                  <br /><br />Studying medicine imparted an experimentally
                  methodical mindset, and 15 years as a culinary-professional
                  engraved an adrenally-fueled fastidiousness that gets the job
                  done while communicating successfully.... even in a stressful,
                  time-sensitive environment working closely with a small-to
                  medium team. A dollop of startup-style business branch
                  construction and guidance has rounded my out sales and management
                  soft skills,
                  lending a unique blend of perseverance and breadth of
                  experience to any team.
